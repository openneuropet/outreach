## About PET BIDS

PET BIDS was presented at the annual [International NeuroInformatics Coordinating Facility](https://www.incf.org/about-incf) meeting 2020 (see the [talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dl_crraH6LQ-LyrrWOPEg2Cx5M7fpdMR/view?usp=sharing) and follow-up [debrief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-S0bCYimq0)), and the specification development presented during the annual [Organization for Human Brain Mapping](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/) annual conference [2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaTeKKxKzrw) and further 'derivatives' to create in [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ThzGy40Iig) during the open science session.

PET-BIDS and the OpenNeuroPET project with application for brain tumour was presented ([slides here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16652794.v1)) at the COST action [GliMR2.0](https://glimr.eu/) annual meeting.

## Talks about data sharing

We discussed data sharing issues in EU and how OpenNeuroPET implements data sharing ([The case of opening brain images to advance cognitive and clinical neuroscience](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16652761.v1)) during then [European Network of Research Integrity Offices](http://www.enrio.eu/) 2021 conference. A related discussion in the context of clinical data was also presented at the [European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology](https://www.esmrmb.org/congress/esmrmb-2021/) 2021 annual meeting ([Data sharing standard for brain tumour imaging in the era of GDPR](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16676521.v1)).

## Talks about PET data processing

One of our favourite tool at OpenNeuroPET is [PETSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PetSurfer). If you haven't heard about it, [check out this video from Doug Greve](https://youtu.be/1-sgAct6_NY?t=1583). To make life easier, you can [wrap PETSurfer in a pipeline with python](https://youtu.be/m3pFVS13U3g), as explained by V. Beliveau during Brain Hack Nordic 2021.
