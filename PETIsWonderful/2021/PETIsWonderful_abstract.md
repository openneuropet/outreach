## Body
At present there exists little to no standardization between/within PET Neuroimaging data produced by 
researchers; analysis tools and methods are often as unique and inaccessible as the the data they are used on. 
These factors often compound deleteriously and can lead to irreproducibility and duplication of work within the 
community. Two notable efforts towards data standardization within the Neuroimaging community have been the 
development of the BIDS standard and, more specifically to PET, the publishing of "Consensus Nomenclature for in 
vivo Imaging of Reversibly Binding Radioligands", Innis et. al. 2007. 

OpenNeuro PET builds off of the aforementioned efforts and seeks to help ameliorate the negative effects 
mentioned above by introducing standardization and a platform to share and distribute to PET Neuroimaging data. 
OpenNeuro PET is a project built around OpenNeuro and BIDS that aims primarily at developing data sharing openly 
(CC0) or securely (DUA-GDPR) with a united front-end and user friendly tools for the BIDS based data curation of 
PET data.

To support this effort OpenNeuro PET has recently introduced PET into the BIDS standard with BEP 009 and is 
conducting further work to introduce PET Preprocessing derivatives into the BIDS standard with BEP 023. 
Additionally, OpenNeuroPET has contributed to 
developing software to validate BIDS formatted PET data with the BIDS Validator and has developed PET 
Neuroimaging and metadata conversion software from image and tabular formats such as DICOM, ECAT, csv, and xlsx 
into BIDS compliant formats with Matlab and Python.

OpenNeuro PET continues to work on updating OpenNeuro.org to better support PET, and is working with popular 
Neuroimaging libraries such as Nibabel and Freesurfer (via PetSurfer) to better support PET both
within and outside of the PET BIDS standard. Simultaneously, OpenNeuro PET is seeking and solicating PET experts 
to educate and collaborate with in these efforts.
