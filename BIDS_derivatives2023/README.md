# BIDS DERIVATIVES MEETING - 21-23 / 06 / 2023

Organized by the [OpenNeuroPET project](https://openneuropet.github.io/), the workshop physically brought together the international working group of the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](www.bids-standard.org) to develop the BIDS specification for derivatives.

This event was sponsored by the [Novo Nordisk foundation](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/) & [The Lundbeck foundation](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en)

### Work done

The workshop consisted of 2 ½ days (Wednesday afternoon - Friday) of collaborative working on aligning the different BIDS extension proposals for derivatives across all neuroimaging modalities (most prominently MRI, MEG, EEG and PET) resulting in updated BIDS derivatives common terms and new guidelines to develop a derivatives BEP. Specific work on advancing the Atlas, Provenance and Common Electrophysiological derivatives also took place.
