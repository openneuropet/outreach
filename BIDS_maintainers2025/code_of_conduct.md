# BIDS MEETING CODE OF CONDUCT

The BIDS meeting is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all of its participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or other identities. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

Everyone violating the Code of Conduct rules that follow may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund, regardless of their stature within the organization.

This Code of Conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels, and direct messages, both online and offline.

Please do not forget that you are responsible to follow the rules listed here, as well as making sure that everyone in the meeting does so as well. Please take the responsibility to be an advocate of establishing and maintaining an inclusive culture within our community.

## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, as a community we aim to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is important to apologize to those affected by our mistakes. By listening carefully and respectfully, and doing our best to right the wrong, one is expected to learn from the experience. We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. We, therefore, expect everyone to be very respectful of different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. This includes being aware of preferred titles and pronouns, as well as using a respectful tone of voice. While we do not assume participants know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, we expect members to recognize and respect differences within our community. This means being open to learning from and educating others, as well as educating yourself.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

## General Rules

We aim to create a discussion platform that welcomes individuals with diverse backgrounds to interact with each other in a positive environment. We encourage the following behaviors that can help to create such an environment:

- Being a respectful listener (not taking up more than your fair share of space);
- Being respectful to other viewpoints (agreeing respectfully, asking questions to understand differing viewpoints);
- Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.;
- Using and encouraging the use of welcoming and inclusive language (using “I” statements to indicate that something is how you feel/think, not how everyone does);
- Giving time to others to think and complete their viewpoints (not jumping in / over other people when they are speaking);
- Showing support to make everyone feel included and welcomed to the discussions independent of the level of knowledge (giving younger professionals space to speak)
- Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs.
- Be open to learning from others.
- Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

## Microaggressions

Incidents can take the form of “microaggressions,” which is a damaging form of harassment. Microaggressions are the everyday slights or insults which communicate negative messages to target individuals, often based upon their marginalized group membership. Over time, microaggressions can take a great toll on mental and emotional health, and the target’s feeling of belonging in science and academia. The following examples can all be labeled micro-aggressions:

- Commenting on a woman’s appearance rather than her work;
- Only directing questions at male colleagues when there are female experts in the room;
- Telling someone of color that they “speak such good English”;
- Forcefully praising meat to an individual with a vegetarian diet;
- Praising alcoholic drinks to an individual who does not consume them;
- Exclusion from a group can be a common nonverbal form of microaggression;
- Microaggressions can be couched in the form of a “compliment,” (e.g. “you’re too attractive to be a scientist”).

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The local event organizers take concerns about harassment seriously and will enforce the standards of acceptable behaviour listed in this Code of Conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Organizers and presenters are similarly subject to the rules in the Code of Conduct.

In all cases, the local organizers will make every effort to stay in clear communication with anyone who reports a problem, maintaining confidentiality. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team.

## Reporting procedure

If you are being harassed or made uncomfortable, if you notice that anyone in the gathering is being harassed, or if you feel any other concerns regarding any disruptive and unacceptable behavior of the others regarding the composure of the gathering please follow one of the options below.

### Report the incident to the event organizers (Recommended option)

Please address your concern to Cyril Pernet (he/him) or Melanie Ganz (she/her). We will respect the privacy and security of the reporter and the incident itself. All reports will be handled with discretion.

### Address it directly:

For smaller incidents that might be settled with a brief conversation, you can choose to direct messaging to the person in question or set up a video chat to discuss how it affected you. Please use this approach only if you feel comfortable; you do not have to carry the weight of addressing these issues yourself. If you’re interested in this option but unsure how to go about it, try discussing with the event organizers first — they will have advice on how to make the conversation happen and can also join you in a conversation.
