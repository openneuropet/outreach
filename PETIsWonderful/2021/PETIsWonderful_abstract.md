## Body
At present there exists little to no standardization between/within PET Neuroimaging research produced data; 
analysis tools and methods are often as unique and inaccessible as the the data they are used on. 
These factors often compound deleteriously and can lead to irreproducibility and duplication of work within the 
community.

OpenNeuro PET builds off of the aforementioned efforts and seeks to help ameliorate the negative effects 
mentioned above by introducing standardization and a platform to share and distribute to PET Neuroimaging data. 
OpenNeuro PET is a project built around OpenNeuro and BIDS that aims primarily at developing data sharing openly 
(CC0) or securely (DUA-GDPR) with a united front-end and user friendly tools for the BIDS based data curation of 
PET data. 

To support this effort OpenNeuro PET has integrated PET into the BIDS standard and is 
conducting further work to introduce PET Preprocessing derivatives into the standard with BEP023. 
Additionally, OpenNeuroPET has contributed to developing software to validate BIDS formatted PET data with 
the BIDS Validator and has developed PET Neuroimaging and metadata conversion software from image and tabular 
formats such as DICOM, ECAT, csv, and xlsx into BIDS compliant formats with Matlab and Python.

OpenNeuro PET continues to work on updating OpenNeuro.org to better support PET, and is working with popular 
Neuroimaging libraries such as Nibabel and Freesurfer (via PetSurfer) to better support PET both
within and outside of the PET BIDS standard.
