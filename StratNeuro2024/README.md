# Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) tutorial at StratNeuro 2024

In this tutorial we will introduce you to BIDS basics. It's meant for BIDS newbies, since a [survey prior to the event](./StratNeuro2024_intro.pdf) revealed a background without much neuroimaging experience.

First, we will give you a basic BIDS intro before then working on a BIDS basic conversion of a PET phantom data set. 
The [slides](https://osf.io/e3b2m) for the basic intro are freely available on the Open Science Foundation's data sharing server. A special thanks to Ariel Rokem from the University of Washington for making them and sharing them with the community for reuse.

Next, using the [provided Jupyter notebook](./PET_BIDS_tutorial_Colab.ipynb) in this folder and [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/), you will download some phantom data in neuroimaging formats as they come of a scanner and then work on converting it to BIDS format. A special thanks to BIDS maintainer Anthony Galassi for adding additional functionality to the notebook to make it run in any Colab environment. We will also introduce you to a BIDS converter that runs fully online, [EZBids](https://brainlife.io/ezbids/), that though comes with some restrictions for European data users. 

Finally, we will also spend time on how we can utilize data in BIDS format for easy processing of neuroimaging data. We will finish the day by talking about machine learning applications and how BIDS can be useful for them. Those slides are available [here](./StratNeuro2024_part2.pdf)
