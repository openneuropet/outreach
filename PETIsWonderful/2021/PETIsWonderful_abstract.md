## Body
Little standardization exists among PET Neuroimaging data;  analysis tools and methods are often as unique and
inaccessible as the  data they are used on. These factors compound deleteriously leading to irreproducibility 
and duplication of work within the community.

OpenNeuro PET (ONP) seeks to ameliorate some of these issues by introducing further standardization and a platform 
to share PET data. ONP is a project built around OpenNeuro<sup>1</sup> and BIDS<sup>2</sup> that aims primarily at 
developing data sharing openly (CC0) or securely (DUA-GDPR) with a united front-end and user friendly tools for 
the BIDS based data curation of PET data.  

To support this effort ONP has integrated PET into the BIDS standard with BIDS Extension Proposal 009 (BEP 009<sup>7</sup>) and is conducting further work to introduce PET Preprocessing derivatives into the standard with
 BEP023<sup>8</sup>. Additionally, ONP has contributed software to validate BIDS formatted PET data with the BIDS
Validator and has developed PET Neuroimaging and metadata conversion software from image and tabular formats such
 as DICOM, ECAT, csv, and xlsx into BIDS.

ONP continues to work on updating OpenNeuro.org to better support PET, and is working with popular Neuroimaging libraries such as Nibabel<sup>3</sup> and PetSurfer<sup>4</sup> to better support PET both within and outside of the PET BIDS standard.
