        "Welcome to the hands-on tutorial on Molecular Imaging based on Open Access Datasets. This notebook will guide you through the installation and use of several important neuroimaging software tools, including FreeSurfer and FSL, using Python and Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab. We will use open access datasets to demonstrate real-world neuroimaging data preprocessing of PET data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "- Learn how to install necessary neuroimaging tools in Colab.\n",
        "- Understand how to process neuroimaging data using these tools.\n",
        "- Apply this knowledge to open access datasets for practical understanding.\n",
        "\n",
